This is my personal website, built using Sergey.

## Sergey

Sergey is a tiny lil’ static site generator. It’s a progressive tool designed to site atop your already brilliant HTML. In essence, Sergey is HTML + partials with slots thrown in for good measure.

## Installation

```bash
$ npm install

# Build the site
$ npm start

# Run Sergey in dev mode
$ npm run dev
```
